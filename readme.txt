Make your links sorta fancy.

== Description ==
Regular links are boring, they're easy to miss and they aren't really doing their job. What's worse than providing a link for your users that they don't click on. That's what we are trying to fix with Fancy Links. We want to help users find a visit the links you provide. This is done visually and by giving them a preview of what they are clicking on. Using Fancy Links is guaranteed to increase your link clicks by 5000% or we'll refund your $0.00 purchase price.
